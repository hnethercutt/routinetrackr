<!--ABOUT-->
## About
I wanted to have in my portfolio some things I've learned in school, so I decided to make this app with C++, using linked lists. The structure is inspired by one of my school projects. 
I chose to create a routine tracker specifically because every tracker app I could find is specifically meant for building habits. I have the habits already, I want to see how long I keep it up.
